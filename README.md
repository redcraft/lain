**Serial Experiments Lain**

Nothing special. Just my serial experiments with Docker. However, the fact that they are mine make them special for me.

List of resources to follow:

1. [Docker for beginners](https://prakhar.me/docker-curriculum/) - extremly good tutorial;
2. [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/dockerignore-file).
